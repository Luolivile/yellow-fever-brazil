Exploratory analysis of yellow fever surveillance data in Brazil (1994–2025), including human cases and non-human primate epizootics.

## Background
Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease maintained in sylvatic transmission
cycles involving non-human primates. In Brazil, epizootic surveillance is a key
component of early outbreak detection.

## Data
Public surveillance data (1994–2025) were obtained from dados.gov.br and include:
- Human yellow fever cases
- Non-human primate epizootic events

## Methods
Annual counts were aggregated by year and macro-region. Human cases were grouped
by year of symptom onset (ANO_IS), and epizootic events by year of occurrence
(ANO_OCOR).

## Key Findings
- Temporal alignment between epizootic events and human cases was most evident
  during major outbreak periods (e.g., 2016–2019).
- Regional patterns varied substantially, with strong alignment in the Southeast
  and weaker or inconsistent patterns in other regions.
- Epizootic activity was often observed without corresponding human cases,
  highlighting the context-dependent role of primate surveillance.

## Limitations
- Surveillance intensity and reporting practices changed over time.
- Data are descriptive and do not support causal inference.
- Underreporting may vary by region and period.

## Why this matters
Understanding the relationship between animal and human surveillance systems is
critical for improving early warning strategies and targeting vaccination efforts.
